				<p>HTML(hypertext markup language)은 웹페이지의 구조를 지정하는 기술적인 언어입니다.</p>
				<p>In 1990, as part of his vision of the Web, Tim Berners-Lee defined the concept of hypertext, which Berners-Lee formalized the following year through a markup mainly based on SGML. The IETF began formally specifying HTML in 1993, and after several drafts released version 2.0 in 1995. In 1994 Berners-Lee founded the W3C to develop the Web. In 1996, the W3C took over the HTML work and published the HTML 3.2 Recommendation a year later. HTML 4.0 was released in 1999 and became an ISO standard in 2000.</p>
